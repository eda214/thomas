Can't wait for a spring filled with oreos, Office episodes, original memes, and olive oil!! - Ellie \n \n \n"

I really miss you and everything that used to happen back when we were living together in B-34, but hopefully we’ll get to reunite soon. In the meantime, though, seeing you on Zoom and hearing the weekly “Oh, hey, dudes!” has always been something to look forward to. Just like your screams when you’re losing (to someone who isn’t me) in Smash, your energy never fails to carry over any distance, no matter how long, and make us smile.\n\nIt would be remiss of me, however, not to mention everything else you bring to those around you. We’re so lucky to have a talented pianist, innovative bot maker, patient pset buddy, and understanding and caring friend among us. Thank you for being the person you are, Tom. I can’t wait to see you again and, once things are back to normal, give you a big hug.\n\nLove,\nEdward";

Your presence, thoughtfulness, humor, wisdom, and willingness to listen have brought light to so many otherwise-difficult moments, from our abrupt departure from school to a very long election night. I’m so grateful to have grown closer to you over the past year, and I can’t wait for the semester ahead with you. Wishing you a day and year full of nature, sunset runs, chocolate, Multigrain Cheerios, good classes, laughter, peace, and happiness — you deserve the world! - Alia \n \n \n"

You keep me on my toes in the best possible way, and though I never know where they will lead, I always look forward to our conversations and other miscellaneous encounters (such as when you stole my phone after CS124 lecture, the photographic evidence of which I encountered when looking for pictures of you in my camera roll, per Edward's request). I hope you have the best day today, and I am looking forward to seeing you in person again soon. At some point we will have to play that Brahms duet that you told me to learn, which I actually did learn over the summer but probably have forgotten at this point. - Rebecca";
