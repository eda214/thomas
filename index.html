I’m so grateful to have grown closer to you over the past year, and I can’t wait for the semester ahead with you.

Shows how consciously and subconsciously I view you as such a reliable and thoughtful friend. From day 1 I've admired your adventure seeking spirit and how dedicated you are to what you put your mind to. You're always there for your friends no matter what and in all your interactions with us you build people up with like solid, humorous comportment! Idk how to describe it, but your \"hey bud\" brightens up so many ppl's days and I know it's made me feel better when life is feeling a bit cloudy. Come to think of it, Tom, you're always so cheery and fun...how does he do it????!! - Anastasia"

Just like your screams when you’re losing (to someone who isn’t me) in Smash, your energy never fails to carry over any distance, no matter how long, and make us smile.<br><br>It would be remiss of me, however, not to mention everything else you bring to those around you. We’re so lucky to have a talented pianist, innovative bot maker, patient pset buddy, and understanding and caring friend among us. Thank you for being the person you are, Tom.
